# Redirected to 1 servlet to another 🧑‍💻👍
This project is a simple servlet application which demonstrates the use of requestDispatcher. RequestDispatcher is an interface in the Java Servlet API which allows a servlet to forward a client request to another resource.<br>
This project consists of two servlets, one to receive the request and the other to handle the request. The first servlet forwards the request to the second servlet which handles the request and returns a response. The response can be used to display a user interface or to perform an action. This project is an excellent example of how to utilize requestDispatcher in a servlet project.
